        "The pocketsphinx model doesn't have a real language model (it came from dictionary, so it's single words only, headwords only), so to show it in the best light, I'm using the data from the website for [Fuaimeanna na Gaeilge](http://www.fuaimeanna.ie/en/) *(\"The Sounds of Irish\")*, which has equivalent pronunciation examples. I've put an old scraper for the site [here](https://github.com/jimregan/wav2vec2-sprint/blob/main/irish/fuaimeanna.pl); this writes a .tsv file with the data, and a shell script to use wget to download the sounds. I already have the data, so I'm just uploading it, but during the sprint I wrote a [script](https://github.com/jimregan/wav2vec2-sprint/blob/main/irish/convert-fuaimeanna-csv.pl) to convert the .tsv to a .csv that `datasets` could read more easily."
